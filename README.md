**Realm database**

Realm Java enables you to efficiently write your appâ€™s model layer in a safe, persisted and fast way. 

**Prerequisites**

 1. [Realm](https://realm.io/) do not support Java outside of Android at the moment.
 2. [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?gclid=COOv_bPoo8oCFcoGcwodcJ4AVQ) >= 0.8.6
 3. A recent version of the Android SDK.
 4. JDK version >=7.
 5. Support all [Android versions](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) since API Level 9 (Android 2.3
    Gingerbread & above).

**Pros:**

 - Fast in implementation
 - Very fast in data loading and saving
 - Easy to learn and use

**Cons:**

 - Not possible to extend anything else than `RealmObject`
 - No other methods except default getters and setters
 - Implementing only interfaces with no methods.

See [other limitations](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#current-limitations).

**Gettings started**
First of all you have to add compile `'io.realm:realm-android:x.xx.x'` dependencies to your project. See latest realm database version on [realm.io](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/).

**Here how it looks like**

```java 
public class User extends RealmObject {

   @PrimaryKey
   private long id;
   private String firstName;
   private String lastName;
   private int age;
   private RealmList<RealmString> contactList;

   //Generated getters and setters
}
```
	
```java 
// Save a new object into database
Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance(); // get a Realm instance for this thread
realm.executeTransaction(new Realm.Transaction() {
            @Override
            public void execute(Realm bgRealm) {
                realm.copyToRealmOrUpdate(obj);
            }
        });
```

```java
// Query with single condition
User user = realm.where(User.class).equalTo("id", id).findFirst();
```

```java
// Query with multi conditions
List<User> userList = realm.where(User.class)
                                  .equalTo("firstName", "John")
                                  .or()
                                  .equalTo("firstName", "Peter")
                                  .findAll();
```

```java
// Query to look for all users
List<User> userList = realm.where(User.class).findAll();
```
